    <h1>GIS map @ http://localhost:8000/example7.html</h1>
    <p>
        In this example we use a published and shared Feature Server from our Development Account
        to show some data on top of the basemap. If no extent is given the data is initially visible
        as a red dot on the map but it is actual GIS data that was generated through a Geocoding service
        from a CSV file and now available as Feature Service on the Esri's ArcGIS platform. The dots are
        the locations of some data about patients around the city of Denver in the USA.
        In this example we focus on the feature just after the map is loaded. How this is doen depends on
        the API used. In addition, in this example we make use of an Image Layer from a Dynamic Map Service
        which shows the median age of the population by zip codes, states etc. Together with the GIS data 
        provided by the layer above it forms the basis of a decent Operational Layer for this map.
