    <h1>GIS map @ http://localhost:8000/example6.html</h1>
    <p>
        In this example we use a published and shared Feature Server from our Development Account
        to show some data on top of the basemap. If no extent is given the data is initially visible 
        as a red dot on the map but it is actual GIS data that was generated through a Geocoding services 
        from a CSV file and now available as Feature Service on the Esri's ArcGIS platform. The dots are 
        the locations of some data about patients around the city of Denver in the USA.
        In this example we focus on the feature just after the map si loaded. How this is doen depends on 
        the API used.
