Most useful PIP commands

1-pip list
2-pip show (name fo the package you want info of)
3-pip search (name of package...)

4-pip freeze => requirements.txt

	prints a list of all currently installed packages and their versions and it does 
	so in a format that pip itself can parse later. This mechanism normally used to
	produce a file named *requirements.txt*.

	The output of the pip freeze can be copied into a requirements.txt file and edited
	i.e. the specific versions may be removed and some of the installed packages too
	according to the case.

5-pip install -r requirements.txt

	This installs all the packages and dependencies in requiremets.txt

Note: The requirements.txt mechanism is designed only for setting up the packages on a
	  developmet machine, not an end user's!
