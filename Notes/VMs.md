#### Windows 10 VM - 90 days trial

A virtual machine for VirtualBox can be dowloaded directly at the URL below.
For example **MSEdge on Win10(x64) Stable (16.16299)** for the **VirtualBox**.
The same sofware is prepackaged for other VM software in addition to VirtualBox.

It is a 4.9 GB download which may take some time to complete.

#### Important Notes

These virtual machines expire after **90 days**. We **recommend setting a snapshot when you 
first install the virtual machine** which **you can roll back to later**. Mac users will need 
to use a tool that supports zip64, like The Unarchiver, to unzip the files. The password 
to your VM is **"Passw0rd!"**
