## Setups

### [How to extract value from setups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNYdfbRZL_w&t=289s)

1. The setup must have a __positively geared ratio (RT)__ 
	that is a good __reward/risk__ ratio i.e. 3/1 which
    means £300 potential gain / £100 potential loss.

2. The setup must have __high probability (SP)__. This means 
   that pattern of the movement of the stock is very likely
   to play out according to a predited model i.e. 70% - 80%
   likelyhood. 

3. Have setup with a __defined risk__. This means that you always
   set bounds over which the trade is exited at a known loss.

4. __Gains are likely going to be larger of losses wit the right RT*SP__.

5. Be __selective with the stocks you choose to trade__.

6. Be __patient__ the market is always there let the right conjunction
   for your setup come to you naturally do not force it.

## High Probability setups for new traders

1. ABCD pattern - long
2. Lower highs/Fader -shorts

### ABCD long

Refs
- [ABCD Pattern Investors Underground](https://www.investorsunderground.com/the-chart-pattern-that-made-me-over-100000-in-trading-profits/)

Typical expectation reward/risk (2:1 to 4:1 and ideally 5:1)

1. __A__ is the push - the stocks gains momentum upwards.
2. __B__ the pullback - the stock price normalises. 
3. __C__ is the upward trend after the second high. 
4. __D__ breaks above A.

#### What to do?

1. Set your risk on B i.e. as a hard stop.
2. Buy at any time just after C.
3. Sell when the upwards trajectory as regained to A or in excess of A.
