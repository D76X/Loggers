## Setups

### [How to extract value from setups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNYdfbRZL_w&t=289s)

1. The setup must have a __positively geared ratio__ 
	that is a good __reward/risk__ ratio i.e. 3/1 which
    means £300 potential gain / £100 potential loss.

2. The setup must have __high probability__. This means 
   that pattern of the movement of the stock is very likely
   to play out according to a predited model i.e. 70% - 80%
   likelyhood. 

3. Have setup with a __defined risk__.
