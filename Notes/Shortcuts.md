## Move the focus from the address bar to the page

With the shortcut [Alt+d] it is possible to focus the address bar. Normally, then you either type a new search or copy the URL to be pasted somewhere into another document. However, at some point you may want to move the focus back from the search bar to the page. In order to do that a custom search engine may be used. I have added one to my Chrome Settings as descibed in the article below.

### VSCODE Accordion View
Open three files in the editor and extend one of the views to its max width. Then by clicking any of teh views in teh editor it automatically expands the selected view to the same max width while minimizing the width of the remaining two views open in the editor. It is possible to cycle through the three views suing the shortcut CTRL+1, CTRL+2, CTRL+3.
