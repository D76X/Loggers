GIS is a tool to analyse GIS data and help to find solution
to complex problems.

### Examples

1. Optimization of the delivery path for a courier.
2. Modelling of environmental effects i.e. a spill of chemicals and evaluation of the effects.
3. Correlation between properties of objects/people and location.

### GIS Workflow

1. Get geopraphic data
2. Visualize **spacial patterns**
3. Analyse **spazial patterns**
4. Share GIS solutions
