## Wanhao Duplicator 4 firmware

One of the thing you might want to do is to upgrade the firmware of your printer.
The reasonyou might want to do that is that accompanying software that connects to
the printers is constantly updated and as new versions of the software are released
some older firmware might no longer be supported. This updates might causes the new
release of the softeare to no longer being able to communicate with or control the
printer. The other reason is that often new firmware includes essential updates and
bug fixes that improve the overall quality of the printed products.

f you do want to run replicator or marlin, you will need to upgrade the control board to at least a RAMPS!

WARNING!!!
YOU MUST ENSURE AFTER UPDATING FIRMWARE YOU FOLLOW THIS STEP!!! If you fail to both reset to factory defaults and validate that your toolhead offsets are both set to 0 you will crash the printer the first time you try to use the left extruder. Finally, do not forget to turn on extruder hold in onboard preferences(not explicitly mentioned in the manual since is this a Duplicator specific item)
