the key I found was to start planning trips to Germany to interview as then prospective employers wouldn't have to "invite" me, and thus be on the hook for my travel expenses.  It took me a year to find a job, all told, but really the first 6 months were a wash as I hadn't learned the trip planning trick to that point.  Once I started saying "I'll be in <your city> these dates and would like to schedule an interview when I am in town" in my cover letters, response rate shot way up.

Do beware though, Engelchen is not kidding with her comments about companies hiring ausl√§nder for cheap labor.  I took a nice paycut to come here, but for me that was ok, and I've since gotten back up to a reasonable salary.  But I don't have a family to support so this could be more of a challenge for you.
