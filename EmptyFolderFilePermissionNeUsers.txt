In order to use WiX to install files and set the permissions of the installed files
on the target system the project must use the WixUtilExtension. Therefore a project 
reference to WiXUtilExtensio must be added.

The WixUtilExtensions provides the attributes that are necessary in the WiX markup
to specify the permissions of the installed files. Once the project reference to the 
WixUtilExtensions is added the WiX mark up must declare the corresponding namespace
as one of the attributes to the WiX element.

xmlns:util="http://schemas.microsoft.com/wix/UtilExtension"

The **PermissionEx** element is provided by this namespace as well the following set of 
attributes. 
=========================================================================================
GenericAll					Gives the user all permissions.
GenericRead					Must have at least one other permission specified. Grants all
							Read privileges: "Read Data", "Read Attributes", "Read Extended
							Attributes", and "Read Permissions".
GenericWrite				Grants "Write Data, "Append Data", "Write Attributes", and "Read
							Permissions".
GenericExecute				Grants "Execute File", "Read Attributes", and "Read Permissions".
Read						Grants	"Read Data".
Write						Grants	"Write Data".
Execute						Grants	"Execute File" permission.

=========================================================================================

The same namespace also provides the User element which can be used to create new users.
This can be accompliched in a Component element by means of the following markup.

Notice that by setting RemoveOnUninstall="yes" the user can be removed by unistalling the 
product.

<!--Creates new user-->
<util:User Id="MyNewUser"
CreateUser="yes"
Name="nickramirez"
Password="password"
PasswordNeverExpires="yes"
RemoveOnUninstall="yes"
UpdateIfExists="yes" />
